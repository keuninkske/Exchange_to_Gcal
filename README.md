# Exchange_to_Gcal
Example python script (works) to pull calendar items from MS Outlook and insert into Google Calendar

My goal was simple:  My wife asked me to find a way for her to import her outlook exchange calendar to Google Calendar so our new Amazon Echo would read her appointments to her in the morning.  I know there are some tools out there that will do this, but her company will not let her install any unapproved software and also, I like python, so challenge accepted.

I documented in the comments all my resources, but it took a bit of doing to get by hands on all the answers, so I thought I would share this with the world in hopes that the next person choosing to do this from scratch can navigate to the answers a little easier.
